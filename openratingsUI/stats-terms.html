The mean is the standard statistic we all know and love, and the one which
is used on the professor evaluation pages. Surprisingly, it's not a very good
"summary statistic" because it gives equal weights to every evaluation. But, 
it's what we use most commonly because it's how <i>we're</i> graded as
students and it's a statistic everyone knows and understands.</td>

<td align="center" valign="top"><b>Median</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The "center" value of the ordered data set. If we were looking
at 7 evaluations and put the scores students gave those professors in order for
those 7 evaluations, the median values would come from the third evaluation.
</td>
<td>
A better summary statistic to provide the center of a distribution of values.
Only moderately applicable to the way professors are rated, though beacuse the
majority of distributions found here are multi-model (i.e. they have numerous
centers), and the spread of values can be so small, especially when done
with only a few evaluations.
<p>
When compared to the mean, the median <i>can</i> give some indication of the
direction and degree of <i>skew</i> in the distribution. That is: if the
median is above the average, the distribution favors higher values, and if
the median is below the mean, more students answered the questions negatively,
with lower scores.
<p>
Keep this idea of skew and center in mind when evaluating the <i>spread</i>
of values.
</td>
</tr>
<td align="center" valign="top"><b>Mode</b></td>
<td valign="top">
The most common answer found in the data set.
<p>
As a very simple example: if 1 person gave a professor an 'F', 2 people, a 'D',
4 people a 'C', 10 people a 'B' and 4 people an 'A', the mode would be a grade
of 'B'.  The scores are given as their numerical values, so 0 is an F and 
4 is an A.
<p>
In the case of a tie, the higher 'grade' is picked.
</td>
<td>
Not extremely useful for any statistical purpose, but it does given an idea
of what the majority of your peers thought of this professor in the various
areas they were ranked in.
</td>
</tr>
<td align="center" valign="top"><b>Standard Deviation</b></td>
<td valign="top">
Measures the spread of the values in a uniform distribution.
<p>
The numerical value given assumes the distribution of values is uniform
(which it most likely isn't), and then calculates the <i>deviation</i>
of values in the distribution from the center. Generally, the higher the
number, the larger the range of grades students gave a particular professor.
<p>
The numerical value indicates what percentage of answers fall within
a +/- range of it. About 68% of all answers will fall in between one
standard deviation from the center, about 95% will fall in between two
standard deviations, and about 99.7% will fall in between three standard
deviations.
<p>
A simple example: if the center of a professor's grade is 3.2 with a standard
deviation of 0.5, then about 68% of students rating this professor rated
them in between a 2.7 and a 3.7; about 95% of them rated the professor 
somewhere in between a 2.2 and a 4.0 (would be a 4.2, but 4.0 is the highest
rating).
</td>
<td>
The standard deviation is included to give some idea of the spread, but its
use is flawed in a number of very serious ways. First of all, the concept
of a standard deviation is based upon a uniform distribution, which these
scores most certainly are not.
<p>
Secondly, standard deviations work with values that are a distance away from
a center of a distribution of values. But what's our center in this data?
Typically, the median is used as a center, but if the median and the mean 
don't match, then the distribution is skewed and the standard deviation is
meaningless <i>anyway</i>. So, for our purposes, either the median or the
mean <i>could</i> be used, but both are inherently incorrect, unless they're
basically equal to each other. We recommend using the mean as a basis for
the center value.
<p>
Finally, standard deviations work best on large sets of data with many varied
possible values. That's not the case with here. Often
times, data is based on a few evaluations, and there's a finite set of
values that are possible in terms of rating a professor (the positive,
real integers). This limits the standard deviation's effectiveness to 
accurately describe spread (we really should be using quartiles to describe 
spread, which we may add as a feature at some point).
